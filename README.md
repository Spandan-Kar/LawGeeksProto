# LawGeeks: AI-Powered Legal Document Demystifier  

## Overview  
**LawGeeks** is an AI-powered legal assistant designed to demystify complex legal documents for everyone.  
It tackles the problem of confusing legal jargon in contracts and agreements, which often exposes individuals to hidden risks and unfavorable terms.  

By translating dense *“legal-speak”* into simple summaries and providing proactive risk analysis, LawGeeks empowers non-legal professionals to understand exactly what they're signing with confidence.
